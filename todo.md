# TODO notes:

## A better way to handle unEnabled nodes:
- implement advanced pooling instead of disposing nodes?
  -> less object creations

## Create mesh after all vertex data is calculted
- DON'T UPDATE

## Scene optimisation
- Merge meshes that can be merged if its more efficient

## Collision
- Camera must collide with surface instead of minZ

## Camera movements
- debrecate arc rotate camera
- tabletop -> free cam, mobile -> virtual joystick?

## Terrain colors: 
- More realistic terrain coloring

## Better Terrain algorithm:
- Different bioms etc?
- More general height map in distance
- Slopes and faster gain for pearly noise?

## Procedural trees
## Space background
## Generation parameters with multiple presets for environments
