# Procedural planet generation

This was my first personal project with Babylon.js. I'm really interested in massive world generations and optimisations behind it. Beacuse javascript is not an asyncronous language, optimizing smooth rendering of complicated terrain was a challenge.

## Features
- Built with Babylon.js
- Procedurally generated spherical terrain
- Procedurally generated renderering
- Mesh geometry changes real time when camera moves (no built in LOD)
- Custom mesh made with different algorithms
- PBR-materials
- Debug keycodes


#### KEYCODES for debug:
W -> All materials into wireframe-mode (according to materials)
B -> Bounding boxes for individual meshes
S -> Stop planet geometry from updating
I -> Show Inspector
