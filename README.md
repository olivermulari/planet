# Procedural planet generation

..Work in progress

This is my first personal project with Babylon.js. I'm really interested in massive world generations and optimisations behind it. Beacuse javascript is not an asyncronous language, optimizing smooth rendering of complicated terrain is a big challenge.

## Features
- Build with babylon.js
- Procedural planet generation
- Procedural renderer -> Geometry changes when camera moves
- PBR-materials
- Custom geometries made with different algorithms
- Debug keycodes


KEYCODES:
W -> All materials into wireframe-mode (according to materials)
I -> Show Inspector
